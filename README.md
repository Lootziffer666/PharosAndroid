# Pharos

Pharos is a dual-platform **document intelligence system** for **Android** and **Windows Desktop**.
Both platforms share a common sync protocol and provenance model via pure Kotlin/JVM core modules.

## What is Pharos?

**Pharos Android** is a native Android application that scans local document folders, analyses them
with a pluggable LLM backend, clusters them into projects, and writes Markdown "masterfiles" that
summarise each project. It supports a hybrid model where light processing happens on the phone and
heavier pipelines run on a PC-hosted local LLM gateway (Ollama or custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint).

**Pharos Desktop (Windows)** is a Compose for Desktop application that picks local and shared/network
folders, generates SHA-256 sync manifests, shows visual diffs between two folders, and syncs a shared
folder into a local destination. It uses the same `pharos_manifest.json` protocol as the Android app,
enabling bi-directional sync without a cloud intermediary.

`✦` marks the two fully platform-agnostic modules that are shared by Android and Desktop today.
`core/model`, `core/storage`, `core/llm`, and all `provider/` modules are currently Android-specific.
Full KMP migration (Room → SQLDelight, OkHttp → Ktor, Hilt → Koin) is the recommended long-term path
— see [`docs/ROADMAP_WINDOWS_SYNC.md`](docs/ROADMAP_WINDOWS_SYNC.md) for the detailed plan.

## Shared modules

### `core/sync`
Manifest-based delta sync protocol shared by Android and Desktop:
- `SyncManifest` / `ManifestEntry` — JSON file manifest (path, hash, size, timestamp)
- `ManifestComparator` — diffs two manifests → `SyncDiff` (added / modified / deleted / unchanged)
- `FileHasher` — SHA-256 hashing for files, streams, and byte arrays
- `SyncEngine` — manifest generation, read/write `pharos_manifest.json`, one-way sync
- `SyncConflictDetector` — surfaces bi-directional edit conflicts with provenance metadata
- **33 unit tests**

### `core/truth`
Provenance-first truth model for transparent data lineage:
- `ProvenanceLevel` — SOURCE → EXTRACTION → DERIVATION → HYPOTHESIS
- `VerificationState` — Unverified / Confirmed / Disputed / Outdated
- `TrustMetadata` — freshness, staleness, safe-to-resume classification
- `TrustAssessment<T>` — wraps any value with full trust context and labels
- `ProvenanceRecord` — links claims to source evidence with derivation chains
- `ProvenanceClassifier` — classifies AI analysis, file scans, clustering by provenance level
- **71 unit tests**

## Build

```bash
# Android Debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Windows Desktop JAR
./gradlew :desktop:packageUberJarForCurrentOS
```

## Test

```bash
# Shared JVM modules (no emulator required)
./gradlew :core:truth:test :core:sync:test --no-daemon

# Android app unit tests
./gradlew :app:test --no-daemon
```

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflow [`build-apk-desktop.yml`](.github/workflows/build-apk-desktop.yml) builds both targets on every push and pull request:
- **Ubuntu runner** → Android Debug APK artifact (`pharos-debug`) + unit tests
- **Windows runner** → Desktop uber JAR artifact (`pharos-desktop-windows`) + `core:sync` tests
